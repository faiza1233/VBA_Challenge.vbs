VBA_Challenge.vbs


Overview of Project:

Using VBA, Steve wants to include the entire dataset of stock market over the last few years. In this challenge, we’ll edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect information that we need to analyse. Then, we’ll determine whether refactoring our code successfully made the VBA script run faster.

Results:

Stock Analysis Outputs Steve wanted to find the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock. Daily volume is the total number of shares traded throughout the day; it measures how actively a stock is traded. The yearly return is the percentage difference in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
(Stock analysis outputs for 2017 and 2018 are in file "Resourses1" ("All_Stocks_Analysis_2017" and "All_Stocks_Analysis_2018"))
By looking at the stocks for both years, it is clear that Stocks for year 2017 made a huge profit while 2018 stocks went in loss.

Refactoring

Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, we aren’t adding new functionality; we just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. Similarly, when we ran our stock analysis after refactoring, it took a lot less time to process.

Summary:

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

Advantages:

Refactoring code makes the code more efficient by taking fewer steps, making the code run faster and by using less memory.

Disadvantages:

However, refactoring might be expensive or risky as it may introduce to new bugs.

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

As mentioned above, refactoring for our project was really helpful as it took a lot less time to process the code. However, after refactoring whenever there was a problem(or a bug) in code, it took us a lot longer to solve those problems.
